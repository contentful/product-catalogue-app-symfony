## Introduction

[Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) provides content infrastructure for digital teams to power websites, apps, and devices. Unlike a CMS, Contentful was built to integrate with the modern software stack. It offers a central hub for structured content, powerful management and delivery APIs, and a customizable web app that enable developers and content creators to ship their products faster.

This is an example of how to use [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com) with the Symfony PHP framework using [ContentfulBundle](https://github.com/contentful/ContentfulBundle). The app is based on the "Product Catalogue" example space.
